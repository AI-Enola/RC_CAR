PROJECT NAME : RC CAR (SCHOOL PROJECT)

VERSION : 1 (PUBLIC EDITION)

THIS IS A PROJECT USING :
    - PYTHON (GPIO, SOCKET AND WEB SERVER)
    - JS (USER INPUTS AND SOCKET CLIENT)
    - HTML (INTERFACE TO CONTROL RC CAR)


NOTE : DJANGO FILE IS MISSING FROM THIS UPLOADED PROJECT. GOOD LUCK :D


THIS SCHOOL PROJECT WAS FOR A RESUME OF MY COMPUTER PROGRAM :
    - CREATE A RC CAR USING 3D PRINTING
    - USE PROGRAMMING TO CONTROL THE RC CAR
    - USE ELECTRONICS TO MOVE THE CAR WHEELS
    - CREATE DOCUMENTATIONS OF THE RC CAR
    - MANAGE GANTT
    - USE A TYPE OF COMMUNICATION TO CONTROL THE RC CAR

DESCRIPTION : 
USING A RASPBERRY PI I CAN CONTROL MY RC CAR USING A WEB INTERFACE VIA WIFI CONNECTION. IF USER IS USING A MOBILE TWO JOYSTICKS WILL BE DISPLAYED AND HANDLED BY JS
ELSE YOU CAN USE ARROW KEYS TO CONTROL THE CAR (DIRECTION AND MOTOR). FOR DATA HANDLING I CHOOSE PYTHON FOR FAST PROGRAMMING BECAUSE I WAS ALONE ON THIS ONE SESSION PROJECT.
